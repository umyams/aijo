# Artificial Intelligence with Neural Networks

This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network in JavaScript along with an explanation of artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks.

## Neural Networks
Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, called neurons, organized in layers. Each neuron receives input signals, processes them, and produces an output signal. Neural networks can be trained to learn complex patterns and relationships from data.

### Implementation
The JavaScript code in this repository implements a simple feedforward neural network. It consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the target output.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

### Applications
AI has numerous applications across various industries, including:

- **Healthcare**: AI-powered systems can assist doctors in diagnosing diseases, analyzing medical images, and designing treatment plans.
- **Finance**: AI algorithms are used for fraud detection, risk assessment, and algorithmic trading in the financial industry.
- **Transportation**: Self-driving cars utilize AI technologies such as computer vision and machine learning to navigate roads safely.
- **Customer Service**: Chatbots and virtual assistants powered by AI can provide personalized support to customers and improve service efficiency.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the code.
3. Run `node index.js` to execute the neural network program.
4. The program will train the neural network and test its output.
